# Overview
Welcome to my analysis of German Credit dataset, which sourced from [Kaggle - German Credit Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/german-credit), containing customers' information on age, duration, credit amount, checking and savings account statuses, job and housing status, and purposes. This analysis involves data wrangling, mining, and visualization using the R programming language. The variables are analyzed to determine the bank's lending strategy and the portfolio risk profile, and to detect any unusual patterns that may result from financial fraud.  
# The Questions
Below are questions I want to answer in my project:
1. What are the relationships between variables?
2. What are the primary customers of this banks?
3. What are the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio?
4. Are there any ususual partterns in the data? What are the root causes?
